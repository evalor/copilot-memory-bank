user requests update of the memory bank use command with command `update memory bank`. **I MUST** review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md, progress.md, and the tasks/ folder (including _index.md) as they track current state.

now, I will update the memory bank according to the user’s prompt.
